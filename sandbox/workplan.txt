# Worksuite Plan ----------------------------------------------------------

  "handler_SCRIPT.R" is called by the top user
      001 Installs the latest version of the worksuite package
      002 Starts to capture log events to be logged retroactively
      003 Captures basic information around the analytics script to be run
      
      004 Calls worksuite_execute() for the analytics script
          00A Creates the folder to be used for logging and saving outputs
              - Determines the name of new folder
              - Modifies the name of existing folders
              - Creates the new folder and sets as working directory
              
          00B Construct an error handler that, in the case of an error, saves the objects in the environment and dumps the logger
          00C Initialize the logger
          00D Retroactively log events that were passed to the worksuite_execute() file
          
          00E Execute the analytics script
              - As needed, call logging function and saving function
              - As specified, save items to the working directory or the "working folder"
          
          00F Close the logger
          00G worksuite_execute() is closed
          
      005 "handler_Script.R" is closed

# Wish List ---------------------------------------------------------------

  - Run recursive worksuite_execute() within another worksuite_execute()
      * Creates nested folder and returns to the parent folder when complete
      * Logger can optionally be nested or added to parent logger
      
 Â - Update folder with success/failure
